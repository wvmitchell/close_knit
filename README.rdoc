Close Knit is a guide to Denver's neighborhoods. We evaluate several criteria (crime, recreation, and social) to assess areas to live and explore in Denver.

We incorporated ESRI's API to develop maps and Denver's Open Data Catalog to assess neighborhood data.

Our Rails application includes Ruby and JavaScript, Postgres for data storage, and Heroku for hosting.

Team: Will Mitchell, Eric Westerlind, Matthew Grinder, Jerome Biotidara, and Nikhil Taneja
